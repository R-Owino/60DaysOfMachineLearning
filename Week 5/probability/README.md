## Probability for Machine Learning

This slide deck covers the basics of probability that you need to get started with for machine learning. It is mandatory that you understand how probability works, both frequentist and Bayesian probability, to fully grasp algorithms like Naive Bayes for classification, which will be taught right after probability.
